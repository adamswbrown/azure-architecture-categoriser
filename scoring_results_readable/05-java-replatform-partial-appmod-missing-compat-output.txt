Key Drivers:
  • Treatment: replatform (confirmed)
  • Treatment: replatform
  • Runtime Model: n_tier
  • Service Overlap: 1/1 services
  • Possible match - review assumptions carefully

Key Risks:
  • Complexity: Architecture may be over-engineered for the use case
  • Assumption: Assumed team maturity: traditional_it
  • Assumption: Assumed cost posture: balanced
  • Close alternative: Mission-critical Serverless Application With Private 
Networking (31%)
